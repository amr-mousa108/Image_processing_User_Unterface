The primary objectives of the project are: 
 To create an intuitive GUI for users to load, process, and save images without 
requiring extensive programming knowledge. 
 To implement a wide range of image processing techniques, including noise 
addition, brightness/contrast adjustment, filtering, edge detection, and 
morphological operations. 
 To demonstrate the application of computer vision concepts such as pattern 
recognition and image transformation using OpenCV. 
 To provide a modular and extensible framework for future enhancements in 
image processing tasks.
